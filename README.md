# Randon forest regression

Essentially, this is a project where I've been testing some ideas involving pipelines, environment management, along with a random forest regression algorithm. My idea was to test the limits of this type of algorithm, try out some ways of visualizing the model, and explore possible interpretation boundaries.
In this project, the dataset from Kaggle was used: 
# https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equeiroz/acidentes-rodovias-federais-brasil-jan07-a-jul19/data

To achieve satisfactory results, rigorous treatment of my dataset would be necessary.

## This project is not fully up-to-date, as I use it mainly for testing, especially with environments.

If necessary, I can provide the entire environment used and an installation guide. 
Regarding the dataset used, I will make it available on my Google Drive. Feel free to use it.
